## Learning Songs
- Speak to NPCs with the **Bard** class and choose "teach me a song".
- Bards may require a high disposition before they share their music.
- If you cannot find a bard, ask a **Publican** (innkeeper). Publicans will point you to a bard in the same cell.

## Travel Play
- Equip a lute and select a song to play while walking outdoors.
- Playing while travelling grants an *Inspiration* buff.
- Music stops automatically if you enter an interior or sheath your weapon.

## Performing and Earning Tips
- Talk to an innkeeper before 6PM and choose "give a performance" to book a gig.
- Return after 6PM, ready your lute, and pick a song to perform.
- Audience members will tip based on your **Performance** skill, **Luck**, and song difficulty.
- After the performance, speak to the innkeeper again to receive additional payment.
