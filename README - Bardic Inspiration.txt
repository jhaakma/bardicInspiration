     2. INTRODUCTION

*****************************************************************

This mod allows you to use any lute in the game to perform in taverns. Simply equip a lute and choose the song you wish to play. As you perform, patrons will give you gold. It includes 10 beautifully recorded lute recordings to choose from. You can also perform on the road to give a slight boost to fatigue recovery.

Payouts:
* Payout amount is semi-random and based on Speech and personality.
* Time between payouts is reduced with higher Luck.
* Luck and personality improve the chance to get a bonus 4X payout
* Picking a longer song means more gold, but you have to sit through the whole thing
Criteria:
* Can only perform in a Tavern, once a day, between 6pm and midnight

Travel Play:
* Equip the lute while outdoors to play a random tune.
* This will give you the "bardic inspiration" ability for the duration, 
  which will slowly regenerate fatigue.

your morrowind launcher's window. Go in game, and, once you have 
found a lute, equip it to the player and ready it to start playing.

give a performance.

This mod is a heavily modified version of "Better Lutes III" by XAR.

The music, Lute assets and payout messages originated from Better Lutes III

Credits from XAR:

"Huge thanks to Phijama for the wonderful lute,

And kaboodles of thanks to Jac for showing me step by step how to make this version."
